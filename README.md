# hierarchical-clustering
## Description

The dataset is used to create a dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters. The model is then trained with the identified number of clusters, and the results are visualized to show the customer segmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used is 'Mall_Customers.csv', which contains customer information, including their annual income and spending score.
